## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a form of digital marketing where businesses seek assistance from search engines to rank their websites and appear at the top of search engine result pages (SERPs). This marketing strategy aims to increase visibility and attract organic traffic to websites, establishing them as leading traffic generators.

SEO involves both on-page and off-page optimization strategies to enhance a website's ranking. On-page optimization focuses on optimizing web page content, meta tags, headers, URLs, and internal linking, among other factors. Off-page optimization, on the other hand, involves activities such as link building, social media promotion, content marketing, and influencer outreach to improve a website's reputation and authority in the eyes of search engines.

By implementing effective SEO techniques, businesses can improve their online presence, reach their target audience, and drive relevant organic traffic to their websites, ultimately increasing their chances of conversions and business growth.
